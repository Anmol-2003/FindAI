       What is a Convolution Neural Network? 
       A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial intelligence that's really good at recognizing patterns, 
       like in photos or videos. Imagine it like a super-smart detective that can quickly spot and understand different details in an image. 
       It does this by looking at small pieces of the image at a time and learning what each piece means, which helps it recognize things like faces, objects, or even handwrittenÂ notes.
